<a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/%7Erlpage/SEtools/Projects/iEx5FAQ.htm">FAQ</a></h2>   
   
<p>Due dates - see lesson plan: <a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/%7Erlpage/SEtools/syllabusSEf10.pdf">http://www.cs.ou.edu/~rlpage/SEtools/syllabusSEf10.pdf<br>   
</a><i>Note</i>: This project has two deliverables, iEx5dsgn, first, then iEx5, 
later.</p>

  <li>Practice creating and documenting a software design</li>     
  <li>Practice doing proxy-based estimation of software size from historical  
    data and conceptual design</li>     
  <li>Practice writing equation-based software using Dracula ACL2 mode (not      
    Modular ACL2 mode)</li>

  <li><a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/%7Erlpage/SEtools/ABEToutcomes.pdf">ABET   
    Outcomes</a> A, C, H, I, J, K</li>    
</ul>    
    
<h3>Project</h3>    
<p>Generate HTML files that display hand records with travelers extracted from   
XML records of duplicate bridge contests in such a way that, viewed with an HTML   
browser, hand records display in the <a href="http://denverbridge.com/dbHandOfWeek.htf">directional   
format</a> common in newspaper columns on bridge accompanied by the associated   
"traveler," which shows a table of results on the hand, including the   
scores and matchpoints recorded for each play of the hand by competing   
north-south and east-west pairs.</p>          
                  
<p>The XML schema for recording contest data to be processed in this project has    
some changes from the one used in previous projects, and it includes data for    
the traveler tables. You can <a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/%7Erlpage/SEtools/Projects/iEx5files"> download</a> some XML files    
with the new schema, along with some HTML files that    
display hands and travelers extracted from the data.</p>

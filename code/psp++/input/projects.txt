# Project List File
#
# List your projects here, one per line. For each project in this list, there should
# be a cooresponding text file. For example, if you have "myproject" listed, there
# should be a file called "myproject.txt" in this folder. Most recent projects should
# be at the bottom. PSP++ will generate a report for the final project listed, using
# previous projects as historical data.

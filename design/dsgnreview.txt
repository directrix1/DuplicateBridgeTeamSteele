Design Review:

-After looking at getresults we realized that it would be necessary to write a new function getseparateresults
that returns the results data without the board data. This would be used for Personal Score Card.

-Rename some of the get_ functions in the boards module to serialized_ for all functions that return HTML serializations.

-Remove prefix and postfix parameters from serializedresults, thus it only receives xmlnodes. Simplifies getresults to make it more consistent
with the other functions in the boards module. The benefit from prefix and postfix can easily be achieved by the calling 
function.

-Explained the meaning of the <td>&nbsp;</tb>. Used to create a space in the case that the first Total Score is empty.

-Expanded upon psc and rankings to better explain where the data these two modules receives originates from.
	* getNameForID receives names from the rankings data as this is where the names are contained in the xml schema

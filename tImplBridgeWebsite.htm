<h3>Project</h3>         
<p>Design, document, and implement software to generate, from XML data 
files, interlinked HTML files that make it convenient for participants 
in a       
duplicate bridge contest to review results. Contestants should be able 
to see <a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/%7Erlpage/SEtools/Projects/tImplFiles/Ex1/HR051115A.html">boards</a>,       
with or without <a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/%7Erlpage/SEtools/Projects/tImplFiles/Ex1/HRTR051115A.html">travelers</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/%7Erlpage/SEtools/Projects/tImplFiles/Ex1/RK051115A.html">rankings</a>,       
and <a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/%7Erlpage/SEtools/Projects/tImplFiles/Ex1/PSC051115A.html">personal score cards</a>. They       
should also be able navigate among these displays. For example, contestants       
looking at rankings may want to see their personal scorecards. Or, a contestant       
looking at a personal scorecard may want to link to the display for a particular       
board. A contestant looking at a board may want to see expand the view to see       
the traveler associated with it.</p>                
                        
<p> You can <a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/%7Erlpage/SEtools/Projects/tImplFiles.zip"> download</a> some example XML data files and       
associated HTML files containing board displays, travelers, rankings, and       
personal scorecards.&nbsp;</p>                
                        
<p>To get some ideas for designing the interlinked HTML       
files your software will deliver, you might want to look at an <a href="http://www.bridgewebs.com/cgi-bin/bwnd/travellers.cgi?pid=display_hands&amp;msec=1&amp;sessid=314675036769792&amp;event=20101001_1&amp;wd=1&amp;club=denverhousecards">existing       
website</a>.<br>    
<i>Note</i>: This website one is more elaborate and contains more kinds of data than the example XML files       
provided for this project.</p>

dropbox submissions</h3>

<ol>     
  <li>Requirements stating the services that the software will provide, including       
    the interlinking scheme designed for the convenience of contestants in       
    reviewing results.</li>      
  <li>Design describing the planned architecture of modules comprising the       
    software, interfaces between components, and services supplied by modules       
    and components, with annotations from design review<br>     
    <i>Note</i>: Design review focuses on finding defects in the design. Annotations       
    describe defects found and, for each defect, specify which team member will       
    follow up with a solution. Annotations may be hand written and do not need       
    to be cleaned up for presentation. The goal is to document the review       
    proceedings and results.</li>

<h4><i><font color="#0000ff">tPoster </font></i>(paper submission and     
poster-session participation; no dropbox submission required)</h4>             
<blockquote>    
  <p>The team will prepare a product demonstration and poster presentation (one      
  science-fair style poster, describing the project history, results, and      
  features) suitable for supporting one-on-one discussions about the team      
  project with other students and faculty members. Team members will conduct      
  their demo and display and discuss their poster with visitors during the      
  Poster Presentation Session.&nbsp;</p>     
  <p>During part of the afternoon, team members will be discussing its poster      
  with others, and in the remainder of the afternoon, they will be visiting the      
  poster presentations of teams from other courses. All team members must be      
  present for the during the entire session. (If you have a conflict that      
  prevents your presence at all or part of the session, please discuss it with      
  the instructor.)</p>     
  <p>At least two team members must be with the poster at all times. Team      
  members not on duty with the poster will be talking to other presenters, many      
  of whom will be students representing other projects and courses, not SE      
  students. Arrange your schedule so that you are working at your poster during      
  half of the period and visiting other posters during the remaining half.</p>     
  <p><b>Poster Guidelines<br>     
  </b>When preparing your poster, imagine trying to pitch your software      
  product to an engineering manager knowledgeable about software, but who knows      
  nothing about what your product does or how it does it. Your poster should be      
  visually appealing, easy to read from three feet away, and attractive from      
  eight feet away. It should elucidate ideas in a way that prompts questions      
  from interested observers, giving you a chance to describe your product in      
  more detail.&nbsp;</p>     
  <p>A 30"x40" poster board and easel to support it will be provided, along with some      
  kind of horizontal surface for a laptop. Could be as primitive as a chair. No      
  power. Teams are responsible for mounting their presentation to the board and      
  setting up their demo prior to the Poster Presentation Session. The materials      
  will be available in the poster-session location one hour prior to the      
  session. Further guidelines reside on the <a href="#wiki">poster registration      
  website</a>. However, ignore the guidelines about abstracts, conclusions, and      
  "the paper." You won't have those things.</p>     
  <p><b><a name="wiki"></a>Poster Registration</b><br>     
  Register through the following wiki by Monday, November 30:<a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/twiki/bin/view/TWiki/TWikiRegistration"><br>     
  </a><a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/twiki/bin/view/ComputerScience/CSPosterSessionFall2010">http://www.cs.ou.edu/twiki/bin/view/ComputerScience/CSPosterSessionFall2010</a><br>     
  One member from each team must register the team's poster. That team member's      
  name and email address go into the registration (but list all team members as      
  authors). The team should agree on a password. Use the team name for the      
  WikiName entry. Leave the entry for "organization name" blank, but use <a href="http://www.cs.ou.edu/">http://www.cs.ou.edu</a>      
  for the URL of the organization.</p>
